## âœ… Day 1: String Encoding & Basic Transformations

1. Replace all vowels in a string with a symbol `%`.
2. Reverse each word in a sentence.
3. Check if two strings are anagrams.
4. Toggle case of each character in a string.
5. Remove all duplicates from a string.
6. Count frequency of characters in a string.
7. Encode a message based on character rules (like vowel â†’ %, etc.).
8. Check if a string is a palindrome.

## âœ… Day 2: Substring & Pattern-Based String Logic

1. Find longest substring without repeating characters.
2. Count all palindromic substrings in a string.
3. Count number of words in a string.
4. Implement `strstr()` function (return index of substring).
5. Compress a string like `aabcccccaaa â†’ a2b1c5a3`.
6. Check if one string is rotation of another.
7. Remove specified characters from a string.

## âœ… Day 3: Array Traversal + Basic Operations

1. Max profit in stock prices (Buy and Sell Once).
2. Find max and min element in an array.
3. Find second largest and second smallest element.
4. Remove duplicates from a sorted array.
5. Left rotate array by one position.
6. Check if array is sorted and rotated.
7. Find missing number in range 1 to n.

## âœ… Day 4: Subarrays, Sliding Window & Prefix Sum

1. Maximum sum subarray (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm).
2. Longest subarray with given sum (positive integers).
3. Count subarrays with sum divisible by k.
4. Check if any subarray has sum 0.
5. Maximum average subarray of size k.
6. Find equilibrium index in an array.

## âœ… Day 5: 2D Arrays + Advanced String Pattern

1. Print a matrix in spiral order.
2. Rotate a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Search for an element in a sorted 2D matrix.
4. Count frequency of a given word in a string.
5. Implement custom `strstr()` logic.
6. Count vowels and consonants in a string.

### ðŸŽ¯ Tip:
- Practice in your preferred language (C++, Java, Python)
- Write test cases
- Focus on logic, edge cases, and performance
- Use pen and paper to dry-run logic for complex problems
